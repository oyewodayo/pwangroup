                        Jayne Onwumere is a woman with laser focus and determination. At a time when Nigeriaâ€™s employment market was dwindling and some families losing their homes due to a lack of funds to pay rent, Jayne and her darling husband Augustine Onwumere received a God-given vision to make homeownership dream a reality for as many people as possible.
                        This dream birthed the Real Estate Network Marketing Company in March 2012 with the Pioneer Company known as PWAN HOMES. Through her distinguished skills, she made groundbreaking impacts in the property market with the sole determination to make homeownership as accessible and easy as possible. Her tenacity and doggedness carried the dream many a time and three years into its operation, PWAN HOMES began to open other Companies in partnership with Independent Consultants which today form the PWAN HOMES of more than thirty affiliates.
